# Getting started: Training and prediction with Keras in AI Platform

This code uses [`tf.keras`](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) to train a classifier on the [Census Income Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). It's designed so you can run the training on [Cloud Machine Learning Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine). To learn how to use this code, view the Getting Started tutorial in one of the following formats:

* Work through the tutorial as [a Jupyter notebook on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/blob/master/notebooks/tensorflow/getting-started-keras.ipynb).

* View the [tutorial notebook in GitHub](../../notebooks/tensorflow/getting-started-keras.ipynb). You can download and run it in any Jupyter environment you would like.

* Read the [tutorial in the AI Platform documentation](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/getting-started-keras).
